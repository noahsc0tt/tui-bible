# Psalms 87

(1) A Psalm of the sons of Korah. A song. He has founded His city on the holy mountains.

(2) The LORD loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.

(3) Glorious things are ascribed to you, O city of God. Selah

(4) “I will mention Rahab and Babylon among those who know Me—along with Philistia, Tyre, and Cush—when I say, ‘This one was born in Zion.’”

(5) And it will be said of Zion: “This one and that one were born in her, and the Most High Himself will establish her.”

(6) The LORD will record in the register of the peoples: “This one was born in Zion.” Selah

(7) Singers and pipers will proclaim, “All my springs of joy are in You.”
