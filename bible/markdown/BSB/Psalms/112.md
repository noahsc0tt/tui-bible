# Psalms 112

(1) Hallelujah! Blessed is the man who fears the LORD, who greatly delights in His commandments.

(2) His descendants will be mighty in the land; the generation of the upright will be blessed.

(3) Wealth and riches are in his house, and his righteousness endures forever.

(4) Light dawns in the darkness for the upright—for the gracious, compassionate, and righteous.

(5) It is well with the man who is generous and lends freely, whose affairs are guided by justice.

(6) Surely he will never be shaken; the righteous man will be remembered forever.

(7) He does not fear bad news; his heart is steadfast, trusting in the LORD.

(8) His heart is assured; he does not fear, until he looks in triumph on his foes.

(9) He has scattered abroad his gifts to the poor; his righteousness endures forever; his horn will be lifted high in honor.

(10) The wicked man will see and be grieved; he will gnash his teeth and waste away; the desires of the wicked will perish.
