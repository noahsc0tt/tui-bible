# Psalms 43

(1) Vindicate me, O God, and plead my case against an ungodly nation; deliver me from deceitful and unjust men.

(2) For You are the God of my refuge. Why have You rejected me? Why must I walk in sorrow because of the enemy’s oppression?

(3) Send out Your light and Your truth; let them lead me. Let them bring me to Your holy mountain, and to the place where You dwell.

(4) Then I will go to the altar of God, to God, my greatest joy. I will praise You with the harp, O God, my God.

(5) Why are you downcast, O my soul? Why the unease within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise Him, my Savior and my God.
