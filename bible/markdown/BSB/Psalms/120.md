# Psalms 120

(1) A song of ascents. In my distress I cried to the LORD, and He answered me.

(2) Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips and a deceitful tongue.

(3) What will He do to you, and what will be added to you, O deceitful tongue?

(4) Sharp arrows will come from the warrior, with burning coals of the broom tree!

(5) Woe to me that I dwell in Meshech, that I live among the tents of Kedar!

(6) Too long have I dwelt among those who hate peace.

(7) I am in favor of peace; but when I speak, they want war.
