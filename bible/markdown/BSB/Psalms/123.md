# Psalms 123

(1) A song of ascents. I lift up my eyes to You, the One enthroned in heaven.

(2) As the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maidservant look to the hand of her mistress, so our eyes are on the LORD our God until He shows us mercy.

(3) Have mercy on us, O LORD, have mercy, for we have endured much contempt.

(4) We have endured much scorn from the arrogant, much contempt from the proud.
