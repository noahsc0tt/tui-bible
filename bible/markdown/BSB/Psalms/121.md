# Psalms 121

(1) A song of ascents. I lift up my eyes to the hills. From where does my help come?

(2) My help comes from the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth.

(3) He will not allow your foot to slip; your Protector will not slumber.

(4) Behold, the Protector of Israel will neither slumber nor sleep.

(5) The LORD is your keeper; the LORD is the shade on your right hand.

(6) The sun will not strike you by day, nor the moon by night.

(7) The LORD will guard you from all evil; He will preserve your soul.

(8) The LORD will watch over your coming and going, both now and forevermore.
