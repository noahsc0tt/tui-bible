# Psalms 114

(1) When Israel departed from Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of foreign tongue,

(2) Judah became God’s sanctuary, and Israel His dominion.

(3) The sea observed and fled; the Jordan turned back;

(4) the mountains skipped like rams, the hills like lambs.

(5) Why was it, O sea, that you fled, O Jordan, that you turned back,

(6) O mountains, that you skipped like rams, O hills, like lambs?

(7) Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob,

(8) who turned the rock into a pool, the flint into a fountain of water!
