# Psalms 126

(1) A song of ascents. When the LORD restored the captives of Zion, we were like dreamers.

(2) Then our mouths were filled with laughter, our tongues with shouts of joy. Then it was said among the nations, “The LORD has done great things for them.”

(3) The LORD has done great things for us; we are filled with joy.

(4) Restore our captives, O LORD, like streams in the Negev.

(5) Those who sow in tears will reap with shouts of joy.

(6) He who goes out weeping, bearing a trail of seed, will surely return with shouts of joy, carrying sheaves of grain.
