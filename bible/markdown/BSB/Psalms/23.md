# Psalms 23

(1) A Psalm of David. The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.

(2) He makes me lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside quiet waters.

(3) He restores my soul; He guides me in the paths of righteousness for the sake of His name.

(4) Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.

(5) You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.

(6) Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever.
