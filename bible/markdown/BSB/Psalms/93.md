# Psalms 93

(1) The LORD reigns! He is robed in majesty; the LORD has clothed and armed Himself with strength. The world indeed is firmly established; it cannot be moved.

(2) Your throne was established long ago; You are from all eternity.

(3) The floodwaters have risen, O LORD; the rivers have raised their voice; the seas lift up their pounding waves.

(4) Above the roar of many waters—the mighty breakers of the sea—the LORD on high is majestic.

(5) Your testimonies are fully confirmed; holiness adorns Your house, O LORD, for all the days to come.
