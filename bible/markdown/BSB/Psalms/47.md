# Psalms 47

(1) For the choirmaster. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. Clap your hands, all you peoples; shout unto God with a voice of triumph.

(2) How awesome is the LORD Most High, the great King over all the earth!

(3) He subdues nations beneath us, and peoples under our feet.

(4) He chooses our inheritance for us, the pride of Jacob, whom He loves. Selah

(5) God has ascended amid shouts of joy, the LORD with the sound of the horn.

(6) Sing praises to God, sing praises; sing praises to our King, sing praises!

(7) For God is King of all the earth; sing profound praises to Him.

(8) God reigns over the nations; God is seated on His holy throne.

(9) The nobles of the nations have assembled as the people of the God of Abraham; for the shields of the earth belong to God; He is highly exalted.
