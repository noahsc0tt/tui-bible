# Psalms 124

(1) A song of ascents. Of David. If the LORD had not been on our side—let Israel now declare—

(2) if the LORD had not been on our side when men attacked us,

(3) when their anger flared against us, then they would have swallowed us alive,

(4) then the floods would have engulfed us, then the torrent would have overwhelmed us,

(5) then the raging waters would have swept us away.

(6) Blessed be the LORD, who has not given us as prey to their teeth.

(7) We have escaped like a bird from the snare of the fowler; the net is torn, and we have slipped away.

(8) Our help is in the name of the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth.
