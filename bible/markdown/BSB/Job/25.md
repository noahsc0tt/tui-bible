# Job 25

(1) Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:

(2) “Dominion and awe belong to God; He establishes harmony in the heights of heaven.

(3) Can His troops be numbered? On whom does His light not rise?

(4) How then can a man be just before God? How can one born of woman be pure?

(5) If even the moon does not shine, and the stars are not pure in His sight,

(6) how much less man, who is but a maggot, and the son of man, who is but a worm!”
