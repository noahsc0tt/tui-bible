# Psalms 150

(1) Hallelujah! Praise God in His sanctuary. Praise Him in His mighty heavens.

(2) Praise Him for His mighty acts; praise Him for His excellent greatness.

(3) Praise Him with the sound of the horn; praise Him with the harp and lyre.

(4) Praise Him with tambourine and dancing; praise Him with strings and flute.

(5) Praise Him with clashing cymbals; praise Him with resounding cymbals.

(6) Let everything that has breath praise the LORD! Hallelujah!
